# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the System

The Gathering is a web-based virtual co-working platform designed to support remote collaboration through a shared 2D spatial environment. Users are represented by avatars, communicate through real-time text and signaling-based call workflows, and use integrated community features such as events, resource sharing, and forum discussions. This SRS defines the requirements for the current implemented system and serves as a baseline for development, testing, and capstone reporting.

### 1.2 Scope of the System

The implemented scope includes:

- Account onboarding and authentication (email/password, OTP verification, Google OAuth, JWT session handling).
- User profile management (display name, bio, skin, avatar configuration).
- Realm (space) lifecycle (create, read, update, delete, sharing, access control).
- Real-time spatial interaction (join realm, movement, teleport, proximity updates).
- Communication (in-world bubble chat, lobby chat, persistent channels/DMs, call request/accept/reject signaling, media state sync).
- Collaboration features (events with RSVP, resource library, forum threads/posts).
- Administration (admin-only analytics and management endpoints).

Out of scope for the current implemented iteration:

- Service Directory feature (identified in brief as pending approval).
- Native mobile applications.
- 3D/VR implementation.

### 1.3 Definitions and Abbreviations

- API: Application Programming Interface.
- JWT: JSON Web Token used for stateless authentication.
- OTP: One-Time Password for email verification flow.
- RBAC: Role-Based Access Control.
- SFU: Selective Forwarding Unit (Agora cloud media architecture).
- DM: Direct Message channel between two users.
- Realm: A virtual 2D collaboration space.
- RTM: Requirement Traceability Matrix.
- SRS: Software Requirements Specification.
- NFR: Non-Functional Requirement.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 System Perspective

The Gathering is a monorepo full-stack web system with:

- Frontend: Next.js (React, Tailwind CSS, PixiJS).
- Backend: Express.js + Socket.IO + TypeScript.
- Data layer: MongoDB via Mongoose.
- External service dependencies: Google OAuth, Gmail/Nodemailer SMTP, Agora RTC.

The system combines REST APIs for transactional/domain operations and WebSocket events for low-latency real-time interactions.

### 2.2 System Context

Primary context interactions include:

- Client browser <-> backend over HTTPS (authentication, profile, CRUD features).
- Client browser <-> backend over Socket.IO (realm join, movement, messaging, call signaling).
- Backend <-> MongoDB (persistent data storage).
- Backend <-> Google OAuth (social login credential flow).
- Backend <-> SMTP (OTP email delivery).
- Client browser <-> Agora cloud (audio/video transport).

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

- Guest: unauthenticated visitor who can access public pages and begin registration/login.
- Registered User: authenticated user who can join realms, communicate, and use collaboration features.
- Realm Owner: registered user with ownership rights over a realm (settings, updates, deletion).
- Admin: user with `role=admin`, authorized for platform-level management and analytics.
- System Maintainer (indirect stakeholder): development/operations role managing deployment, environment configuration, and quality control.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

- Client runtime: modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
- Frontend runtime: Node.js environment for Next.js build and server rendering.
- Backend runtime: Node.js, TypeScript compilation target, Express server.
- Database runtime: MongoDB.
- Network requirements: internet connectivity for OAuth/SMTP/Agora integrations and real-time Socket.IO communication.

### 2.5 Design Constraints

- Authentication is JWT-based with server-side secret requirement (`JWT_SECRET`).
- OTP email flow depends on SMTP credentials (`EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS`).
- CORS origin is constrained by configured client URL (`FRONTEND_URL`/`CLIENT_URL`).
- Admin features are constrained by RBAC (`role` must be `admin`).
- Realm concurrency is constrained by server logic (maximum 30 players per space).
- Backend uses schema/model constraints (field lengths, enum values, validation hooks).

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

- Users have stable internet for real-time collaboration.
- Browser grants microphone/camera permissions for media-related features.
- MongoDB is available and reachable at runtime.
- External providers (Google OAuth, SMTP service, Agora cloud) are operational.
- Environment variables are configured before deployment.
